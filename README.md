# The Ticklist

The Ticklist is a single page application that allows users to keep track of the climbs that they have sent, and keep a list of climbs that they would like to do. This application was built with vanilla JavaScript utilizing a RESTful API built with Ruby on Rails and Postgres database.

## Getting Started

1. git clone the backend repository (https://github.com/jpsypek/mod-3-ticklist-api)
2. run rails db:create to create the Postgres db
3. run rails db:seed to seed the db
4. run rails s to run the backend server
5. git clone this repo
6. run lite-server to frontend server
